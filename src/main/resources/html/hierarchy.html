<body>
    <h1>Document Title (H1) - Used once as main document heading</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Section Level (H2) - Logically follows H1 in hierarchy</h2>
        <p>Regular paragraph text - Always contained within sectioning elements</p>

        <article>
            <h3>Subsection (H3) - Must follow H2 without skipping levels</h3>
            <p>Another paragraph - Maintains proper nesting under its heading</p>

            <h4>Sub-subsection (H4) - Shows continued logical depth</h4>
            <p>Content under H4 - All headings lead somewhere meaningful</p>

            <h4>Second H4 - Same level allowed under same H3</h4>
            <p>More content - Keeping same hierarchy level is fine</p>
        </article>

        <h2>Second Main Section (H2) - Another logical H2 after content</h2>
        <p>Never use headings just for bold text - they must structure content</p>
    </section>

    <footer>
        <p>Footer content - Should not contain headings as it's not a section</p>
